"""
IT Knowledge Base: The Vector Store
===================================

Stores the knowledge base's chunks in Qdrant, the vector database, running in memory inside this process: one point
per chunk, with its vector, its text and its metadata. It handles:
  1. Making a new collection for EMBEDDING_SIZE-number vectors, compared by cosine; any old one is deleted first
  2. Making the LangChain store on it, which keeps the embedding model for searches
  3. Storing the chunks with the vectors embed_chunks() made for them: no call to Gemini here

Usage (this file only defines these; pipeline.py runs the steps):
    store = make_vector_store(embeddings, EMBEDDING_SIZE)   ->  a new, empty collection, "it_knowledge_base"
    store_vectors(store, chunks, vectors)                   ->  one point per chunk: its vector, text and labels
